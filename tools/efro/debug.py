"""Utilities for debugging memory leaks or other issues.

IMPORTANT - these functions use the gc module which looks 'under the hood'
at Python and sometimes returns not-fully-initialized objects, which may
cause crashes or errors due to suddenly having references to them that they
didn't expect, etc. See https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/59313.
For this reason, these methods should NEVER be called in production code.
Enable them only for debugging situations and be aware that their use may
itself cause problems. The same is true for the gc module itself.

# NOTE: In general we want this toolset to allow us to explore
# which objects are holding references to others so we can diagnose
# leaks/etc. It is a bit tricky to do that, however, without
# affecting the objects we are looking at by adding temporary references
# from module dicts, function scopes, etc. So we need to try to be
# careful about cleaning up after ourselves and explicitly avoiding
# returning these temporary references wherever possible.

# A good test is running printrefs() repeatedly on some object that is
# known to be static. If the list of references or the ids or any
# the listed references changes with each run, it's a good sign that
# we're showing some temporary objects that we should be ignoring.
