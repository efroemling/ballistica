# NOTE: In general we want this toolset to allow us to explore
# which objects are holding references to others so we can diagnose
# leaks/etc. It is a bit tricky to do that, however, without
# affecting the objects we are looking at by adding temporary references
# from module dicts, function scopes, etc. So we need to try to be
# careful about cleaning up after ourselves and explicitly avoiding
# returning these temporary references wherever possible.

# A good test is running printrefs() repeatedly on some object that is
# known to be static. If the list of references or the ids or any
# the listed references changes with each run, it's a good sign that
# we're showing some temporary objects that we should be ignoring.
