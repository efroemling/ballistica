// Ballistica's context system allows its various subsystems to provide
// arbitrary contextual data for commands to use. Standard callbacks and
// other mechanisms are set up to preserve and restore context before
// running, and objects can also be invalidated or otherwise cleaned up
// when the context they were created under dies.
//
// The end goal of all this is to support api styles for end users where
// standalone snippets of code can be useful; ie: something like
// bs.newnode() to create something meaningful without having to worry
// about acquiring a scene pointer or whatever.

// FIXME: Once we have death-callbacks for objects, we should update this
//  to be aware once a pointed-to context has died. Attempting to use the
//  context-ref in any way after that point should error. Currently it just
//  functions as an empty context in that case which is incorrect.
