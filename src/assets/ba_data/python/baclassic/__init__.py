"""Components for the classic BombSquad experience.

This package/feature-set contains functionality related to the classic
BombSquad experience. Note that much legacy BombSquad code is still a
bit tangled and thus this feature-set is largely inseperable from
:mod:`bascenev1` and :mod:`bauiv1`. Future feature-sets will be
designed in a more modular way.

# for type-checking and use the versions in ba*.app.classic at runtime;
# that way type-checking will cleanly cover the classic-not-present case
# (ba*.app.classic being None).
