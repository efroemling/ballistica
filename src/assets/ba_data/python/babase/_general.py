    When passed a bound method as the callable, the instance portion of
    it is weak-referenced, meaning the underlying instance is free to
    die if all other references to it go away. Should this occur,
    calling the weak-call is simply a no-op.

    Think of this as a handy way to tell an object to do something at
    some point in the future if it happens to still exist.

    **EXAMPLE A:** This code will create a ``FooClass`` instance and
    call its ``bar()`` method 5 seconds later; it will be kept alive
    even though we overwrite its variable with None because the bound
    method we pass as a timer callback (``foo.bar``) strong-references
    it::

        foo = FooClass()
        babase.apptimer(5.0, foo.bar)
        foo = None

    **EXAMPLE B:** This code will *not* keep our object alive; it will
    die when we overwrite it with ``None`` and the timer will be a no-op
    when it fires::

        foo = FooClass()
        babase.apptimer(5.0, ba.WeakCall(foo.bar))
        foo = None

    **EXAMPLE C:** Wrap a method call with some positional and keyword
    args::

        myweakcall = babase.WeakCall(self.dostuff, argval1,
                                     namedarg=argval2)

        # The same as calling myobj.dostuff(argval1, namedarg=argval2)
        # (provided my_obj still exists; this will do nothing otherwise).
        myweakcall()

    Note: additional args and keywords you provide to the weak-call
    constructor are stored as regular strong-references; you'll need to
    wrap them in weakrefs manually if desired.
