    This subsystem acts as a registry for classes providing particular
    functionality for the app, and allows plugins or other custom code
    to easily override said functionality.

    Access the single shared instance of this class at
    babase.app.components.

    The general idea with this setup is that a base-class Foo is defined
    to provide some functionality and then anyone wanting that
    functionality calls getclass(Foo) to return the current registered
    implementation. The user should not know or care whether they are
    getting Foo itself or some subclass of it.

    Change-callbacks can also be requested for base classes which will
    fire in a deferred manner when particular base-classes are
    overridden.
