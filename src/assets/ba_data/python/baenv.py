"""Manage ballistica execution environment.

This module is used to set up and/or check the global Python environment
before running a ballistica app. This includes things such as paths,
logging, debug-modes, garbage-collection settings, and signal handling.
Because these things are global in nature, this should be done before
any ballistica modules are imported.

Ballistica can be used without explicitly configuring the environment in
order to integrate it in arbitrary Python environments, but this may
cause some features to be disabled or behave differently than expected.
