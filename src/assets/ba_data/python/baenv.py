"""Manage ballistica execution environment.

This module is used to set up and/or check the global Python environment
before running a ballistica app. This includes things such as paths,
logging, and app-dirs. Because these things are global in nature, this
should be done before any ballistica modules are imported.

This module can also be exec'ed directly to set up a default environment
and then run the app.

Ballistica can be used without explicitly configuring the environment in
order to integrate it in arbitrary Python environments, but this may
cause some features to be disabled or behave differently than expected.

# IMPORTANT - It is likely (and in some cases expected) that this
# module's code will be exec'ed multiple times. This is because it is
# the job of this module to set up Python paths for an engine run, and
# that may involve modifying sys.path in such a way that this module
# resolves to a different path afterwards (for example from
# /abs/path/to/ba_data/scripts/babase.py to ba_data/scripts/babase.py).
# This can result in the next import of baenv loading us from our 'new'
# location, which may or may not actually be the same file on disk as
# the last load. Either way, however, multiple execs will happen in some
# form.
#
# To handle that situation gracefully, we need to do a few things:
#
# - First, we need to store any mutable global state in the __main__
#   module; not in ourself. This way, alternate versions of ourself will
#   still know if we already ran configure/etc.
#
# - Second, we should avoid the use of isinstance and similar calls for
#   our types. An EnvConfig we create would technically be a different
