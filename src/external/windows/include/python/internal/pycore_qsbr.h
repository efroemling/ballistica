// The QSBR APIs (quiescent state-based reclamation) provide a mechanism for
// the free-threaded build to safely reclaim memory when there may be
// concurrent accesses.
//
// Many operations in the free-threaded build are protected by locks. However,
// in some cases, we want to allow reads to happen concurrently with updates.
// In this case, we need to delay freeing ("reclaiming") any memory that may be
// concurrently accessed by a reader. The QSBR APIs provide a way to do this.
